# libRFC

This library is envisioned to contain implementations of various 
protocols and code necessary to implement software and/or algorithms
defined in internet standards and RFC (Request For Comments) documents.
These documents are the foundational documents that govern how 
many ubiquitous services are constructed and communicate on the
Internet.
